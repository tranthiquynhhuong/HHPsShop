# Grocery Shop Flutter
App concept created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using Dart programming language, inspired by [Groceries Shopping App Interaction](https://dribbble.com/shots/6120171-Groceries-Shopping-App-Interaction). 

## About
The app was created to simulate all the system behind the inspiration video. There's no code on backend or other web service. The app is all contained in this repository. The models classes was created to better representate an official development, the repositories classes are simulating a web request. I'm using BLOC pattern as architectural pattern.

### Design Details
As exposed on the inspiration video, there's some small design details also present in this app. That is animation on product image, animation when added to cart, animation on scroll to list of all orders, gridview of product cut according with the radius border corner in the white container, in the screen about the product there's a white shadow near of "Add to cart" which apply a great effect. Plus: removing order from cart list moving to right or left. 
 
### Notes
This code was build in a few hours within 1 day, so all the interactions was made to be similar with the inspiration video, no more screen or special interaction was added on this project so far.
