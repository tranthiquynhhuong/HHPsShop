# HHPs Shop application with Flutter & Google Firebase by HuongTran
App concept created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using Dart programming language, inspired by [Groceries Shopping App Interaction](https://dribbble.com/shots/6120171-Groceries-Shopping-App-Interaction). 

I customed this basic UI below to complete my graduate project

The app was created to simulate all the system behind the inspiration video. With database realtime by Google Firestore. The app is all contained in this repository. The models classes was created to better representate an official development, the repositories classes are simulating a web request. I'm using BLOC pattern as architectural pattern.
